## How do you do, fellow kids? :skateboard:
Hey there! I'm Bartek. Let's me introduce myself:

- My web development path started in 2013, when I was creating my first pages using HTML, CSS and PHP
- Over time, I changed my target to JavaScript, in which I became a ninja :eyes:
- Along the way, I met the React library, with which I have to stay until today and use it on a daily basis at work
- I have participated in projects using Vue and React Native
- I am more and more willing to move towards the backend and designing application architecture, although I am familiar with the frontend and everything related to it
- The language that has absorbed me recently is Go - I am closely watching its development and trying&nbsp;to&nbsp;grasp&nbsp;it

Feel free to contact! :cowboy_hat_face: :call_me_hand:
