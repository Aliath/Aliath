- I started my programming adventure in 2013 creating simple websites.
- With time I took the direction of development in Javascript, in which I became a self-proclaimed ninja.
- On the way I met with the React library, which accompanies me in my work until today.
- Apart from that I had to deal with various technology stacks including Nuxt, Express and even React Native.
- More and more often I direct my development towards application architecture, learning new tools and languages, not focusing exclusively on the front-end.
